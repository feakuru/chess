## Testing

To run tests:
1. Install CPPUnit 
    - For Ubuntu - `sudo apt install libcppunit-dev`
    - For Windows
        - [EXE version for MSVC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit-msvc/files/)
        - For MinGW you will have to [build it yourself from binaries](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27827307/cppunit-with-windowsmingw)
2. Run `make test`
3. The generated `test` executable is runnable and will display results.
